Aim: We are simulating a grocery database that allows you to track items, 
prices, quantities, expenditures, and stock of a grocery store. We want to 
essentially track grocery store transactions and allow for customer interaction 
with the store. We divided our functionality into 4 modules: Items, Bagofgoods,
Expenditures, Store.

Packages needed:
OCaml and OPAM

Installation steps:
1. Clone our git repository: 
git clone https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ay332/cs3110proj
2. Enter directory of project
cd (path to cs3110proj)
3. install opam
4. dune build 

Usage:
So far, we have only included command line functionality for creating an item. 
In the future, we will implement functionality for creating a bag of goods and 
interacting with the store:
1. after dune build, insert command: 
dune exec bin/main.exe

You should see this message:
Welcome to Grocery. 

Please enter the name, price, and quantity of the item you want to create:


2. to create an item, type in its [name price quantity], with the form string int int:

After correctly inputting in this form, 
you should receive a message that says
Successfully created item: "NAME ENTERED" with price: PRICE ENTERED and quantity: QUANTITY ENTERED

Example: 
dune exec bin/main.exe
Welcome to Grocery. 

Please enter the name, price, and quantity of the item you want to create:
"apples" 1 5 
Successfully created item: "apples" with price: 1 and quantity: 5
